Create with this static page layout:
<section className="mt-12 w-full max-md:mt-10 max-md:max-w-full md:px-[100px]">
      <div className="flex gap-5 max-md:flex-col">
</div></section >
// Styling
Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
The background color of the entire section should be inherit.
The heading text in the left section should be bold, red, uppercase, and larger than the rest of the text.
Apply margins, paddings, and spacing to create a clean, well-organized layout.
Ensure responsiveness:
On larger screens, display the text and image side by side.
On smaller screens, stack the sections vertically.
